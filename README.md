## Introduction

A treasure trove of culinary inspiration and information, with over 234,000 recipes at your fingertips, this dataset offers a diverse array of dishes spanning cuisines, flavors, and cooking styles. In this project we are exploring the relationship between the number of calories and the average rating of a dish. 

This data set contains :

Number of rows: 234429 

No of columns: 18 

Columns relevant to question: 

Name - The name of the dish in the recipe 

Nutrition - The nutritional values like calories, total fat, sugar etc 

Ingredients - Ingredients used in making the dish 

Description - Use of words like chocolatey, delicious, sweet etc

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

Description of data cleaning that took place: 

For the nutrition column I turned the strings into actual columns of the form in the form calories (#), total fat (PDV), sugar (PDV), sodium (PDV), protein (PDV), saturated fat (PDV), and carbohydrates (PDV). I also looked at how many missing values there are in each column and replaced them with NaN.

I also binned the 'average_rating' values into specified intervals defined by the bins list and assigns corresponding labels from the labels list to each interval. This way the average rating is not a categorical column which is consistent with the analysis being performed. 
The first 5 rows of the cleaned dataset:

Be sure to completely thaw the broccoli.  I didn&#039;t and it didn&#039;t get done in time specified.  Just cooked it a little longer though and it was perfect.
